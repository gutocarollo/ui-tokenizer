# marathon-stop-gate — Stop hook. Inert when no marathon is active.
# With the marathon located + open items in RUN.md: blocks the stop and
# returns the "Próxima ação". Anti-lockup: N consecutive blocks WITHOUT RUN.md
# changing → releases with a warning (real progress resets the strikes).
#
# MATERIALIZATION (F9-fixes): the runs directory (HARNESS_RUNS_DIR, default
# .harness/runs), the strike cap (HARNESS_MARATHON_MAX_BLOCKS_WITHOUT_PROGRESS,
# default 3) and the registry staleness cutoff (HARNESS_MARATHON_STALE_DAYS,
# default 7) come from .harness/harness.conf via .harness/lib/_tooling_conf.py —
# they used to be hardcoded (the 2 keys existed in the schema since F0 with no consumer).
# The default of HARNESS_RUNS_DIR changed from ".claude/runs" to ".harness/runs"
# in M-ALTA/H4 (post-H3 adversarial audit, symmetric gap) — the old value
# carried "claude" even in codex-only projects; ".harness/" is already
# the neutral/runtime-agnostic directory of the rest of the framework
# (harness.conf, answers.yml, hooks, lib). Projects ALREADY installed keep the
# value recorded in their own answers.yml (Copier does not rewrite an answer
# already given — only the default for NEW installs changes).
#
# CROSS-REPO (measured 2026-08-01, field report from a downstream install):
# this gate used to look ONLY at "$ROOT/$RUNS_DIR/ACTIVE" — a marathon whose
# run directory lived in a different working directory than the session's
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR was invisible, and the gate degraded to a silent no-op:
# no block, no `.stop-strikes`, ever. Location now goes through
# marathon-locate.sh (ACTIVE local — slug or absolute path — then the
# $HOME/.harness/marathon-active registry, pruning stale/dead entries).
#
# Two sibling defects fixed alongside: `^- \[ \]` ignored every indented
# sub-item (a RUN.md with 6 real open items under a parent bullet counted as
# 1), and the strike counter measured mtime, which has 1-second granularity
# (two real edits inside the same second read as "no progress") and reset on
# a bare `touch`. Both replaced below: any indentation of `[ ]`/`[~]` counts,
# and progress is a checksum of RUN.md's content.
