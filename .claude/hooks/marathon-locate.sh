# marathon-locate — where the active marathon lives, resolved ONCE.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Each of the three marathon hooks resolved its root as
# "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR" and stopped there. That assumes the run directory lives
# inside the session's project directory. When a session is opened in one repo
# and the work happens in another working directory, all three degrade to a
# SILENT no-op: the gate does not block, the reinject does not reinject, and the
# precompact does not stamp the journal.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-01. A marathon whose run directory lived in a second working
# directory, driven from a session anchored on a different project directory, ran
# for hours and produced ZERO `.stop-strikes` files, and a compaction of that
# session injected no <marathon-run-state> at all. The report from the field —
# "the marathon gate never re-arms and it always stops" — is exactly this
# mechanism, and nothing in the hooks said so out loud.
#
# The failure is silent BY CONSTRUCTION: `[ -f "$ACTIVE" ] || exit 0` cannot
# distinguish "there is no marathon" (the correct state in the vast majority of
# sessions, and the reason the hook must stay quiet) from "the marathon exists
# somewhere I never looked". Both take the same branch.
#
# TWO SOURCES, tried in this order:
#
#   1. $ROOT/$RUNS_DIR/ACTIVE — the local file. Its content may be a SLUG
#      (historical behaviour, unchanged) or an ABSOLUTE PATH to a run directory
#      (cross-repo pointer, new). A path is accepted verbatim, so a project can
#      point at a marathon that lives in a sibling repository without any of the
#      hooks guessing.
#
#   2. $HOME/.claude/marathon-active — the user-level registry, one absolute run
#      directory path per line. This is what makes a marathon portable across
#      repositories WITHOUT scanning the filesystem: the marathon skill appends
#      a line at bootstrap and deletes it at teardown. Discovery by globbing
#      sibling directories was rejected — it would block a session because of an
#      unrelated repository's forgotten ACTIVE, and a gate with false positives
#      gets disabled by its owner, which is worse than a gate that under-fires.
#
# PRUNING DEAD ENTRIES. The registry is durable state living OUTSIDE any repo, so
# it rots: one forgotten teardown would block unrelated future sessions forever.
# An entry whose RUN.md has not been touched for more than
# HARNESS_MARATHON_STALE_DAYS (default 7) is REMOVED from the registry and
# ignored, as is an entry whose RUN.md no longer exists. The cut is on the mtime
# of RUN.md, not of the directory: the skill requires updating RUN.md every time
# an item closes, so that mtime IS the marathon's sign of life — the same signal
# the strike counter already trusts to tell progress from spinning.
#
# USAGE (sourced by the hooks):
#   . "$(dirname "$0")/marathon-locate.sh"
#   marathon_locate "$ROOT" "$RUNS_DIR" || exit 0
#   # then read MARATHON_RUN_DIR / MARATHON_RUN_MD / MARATHON_SLUG
#   #           MARATHON_SOURCE_KIND (local|registry) / MARATHON_ACTIVE_FILE
#
# USAGE (executed, by the marathon skill):
#   bash marathon-locate.sh register <run-dir>     # idempotent
#   bash marathon-locate.sh unregister <run-dir>
#   bash marathon-locate.sh locate [root] [runs-dir]   # prints the run dir, or exits 1
